<h1>Camtree: The Cambridge Teacher Research Exchange</h1>
<p>Camtree, the Cambridge Teacher Research Exchange, is a new global online platform that supports communities of educators to reflect on, develop, and share their practice, through involvement in research in their own educational settings.</p>
<p>Camtree provides:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Learning and professional development for educators wanting to conduct close-to-practice research in their own educational settings, whether these are formal or informal and ranging from early years to adult education.  This includes online courses, downloadable guides, and webinars with experienced practitioners, University of Cambridge researchers and other experts.</li>
  <li>A unique, open and free-to-access digital library in which teachers can publish their research, and which enables and encourages sharing and development of practice as well as synthesis and application of research findings.</li>
  <li>A growing network of interconnected communities of inquiry, linking teachers and researchers worldwide.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>The Camtree team is based at Hughes Hall, University of Cambridge, and works closely with the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education, as well as other partner organisations. Camtree is part of DEFI, the Digital Educational Futures Initiative, which in turn is part of The Bridge Initiative.</p>
